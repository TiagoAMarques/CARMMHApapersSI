# Preamble

***This will be a general preable common to all the documents included as Electronic Supplements to CARMMHA's offshore injury paper. The exact preamble will be finalized at the time of submission to reflect the submission date and final title, structure, authors etc.***

This is an Electronic Supplement to the paper submited to MEPS on the ??-??-???? by Marques, T. A., Thomas, L., Booth, C., Garrison, L. P., Rosel, P. E., Mullin, K. D. & L. Schwacke entitled "Quantifying Deepwater Horizon oil spill induced injury on offshore cetaceans".

# Background

In this document we describe the required analysis to estimate a baseline survival and the post-oil spill survival, which together provide a survival reduction.

# Baseline Survival

To estimate a distribution for the baseline survival in bottlenose dolphins we consider the sex and age specific survival from the Siler model results. 

Since we need a population-averaged survival rate, to obtain it we multiply the age- and sex- specific survival estimates from the Siler model by the proportion of the population estimated to be in each age- and sex- class.

However, there is one further complication to consider first.  The baseline survival will be compared with survival post-spill that is calculated from a Spatial Capture-Recapture (SCR) model, based on a Photo-ID model. The full SCR analysis is the focus of a dedicated SCR paper by Glennie et al. 2021.  

The SCR Photo-ID estimate of survival is a biased estimate of the population average survival because the population that is makes inferences for not the entire population, excluding the animals that dnot possess natural markings that would make them available to bve marked in the SCR. In particular,  young animals are not represented in the photo-ID catalog -- they tend not to have acquired the markings that enable them to be uniquely identifiable. Hence, a first step is to use a separate dataset on whether animals are marked as a function of known age to estimate the proportion marked in each age class.

We note upfront this wording might cause some confusion. The **proportion marked** could be used to refer to:

1. the proportion of animals that have been marked in a MR context, and
2. the proportion of animals that could be marked in a photo-ID capture recapture context because they have marks tham make them uniquely identifiable.

Here, when we use the wording "proportion marked", we are referring to the latter.

![](figs/Markings.JPG)

Based on this proportion marked, we calculate a baseline survival that can be compared with the SCR estimate by accounting for the proportion of animals (of ech sex) at each age that could have been included in the capture recapture study.

Essentially, a population averaged survival probability ($\bar S$) is given by

$$ \bar S = \sum_{i=0}^{60} \sum_{j=1}^2  s_{ij} \times q_{ij}$$

where

$$ q_{ij} = \frac{p_{ij}\times p(M|i)_{ij}}{\sum_{i=0}^{60} \sum_{j=1}^2 p_{ij}\times p(M|i)_{ij}}$$

where $s_{ij}$ is the survival probability for age $i$ and sex $j$, $p_{ij}$ is the proportion of the population in age $i$ and sex $j$, $p(M|i)_{ij}$ is the proportion of animals of age $i$ and sex $j$ that are marked. Note therefore that $q_{ij}$ is the the proportion of animals maked in age $i$ and sex $j$.

Below we simulate each of these quantities, and propagate the corresponding uncertainty into $\bar S$ by sampling from the distribution of simulations for each of the components.

## Probability of being marked as a function of age

We consider a dataset containing known-age animals (from health assessments, etc.) from Barataria Bay (Lori Schwacke, unpublished data), and performed a binary logistic regression to estimate the probability of an animal being marked as a function of age and other covariates.

For each of these animals there was a record of whether the animals had markings that would allow them to be marked by photo-ID, and hence being included in the pool of animals used to estimate survival from the SECR model.

Read in the data, from file "BaselineSurvSIdata.txt". Note that the original data had additional columns, with different characteristics associated with animals. However, we striped the file from anything that was not found to be relevant. As an example, the sex of the animal is not in the table, because we found no evidence for there to be sex related differences in the probability of an animal being marked as a function of age.

```{r}
#Read in data file
MRdata <- read.csv("InputFiles/BaselineSurvSIdata.txt", sep="")
```

Our objective is to model how the probability of an animal being marked (i.e. having been recruited into the capture-recapture (CR) study in Barataria Bay (BAR) from which we get baseline survival), `Marked` as a function of potential covariates such as its age on capture `AgeCap`. These were fitted with `gam` from package `mgcv`

```{r,warnings=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(mgcv)
```

Preliminary analysis showed that uncertainty was high at age 0, when we know probability of being marked is 0, so we considered a constrained GAM enforcing that P(marked) is 0 at age 0. Besides looking for sex differences, we also investigated imputing zero's for all animals at age 0 to force P(marked|age=0), but the constrained GAM was favoured approach. 

The constrained model considered is shown below

```{r,echo=FALSE}
AgeCap <- seq(0, max(MRdata$AgeCap), length = 1000)
# preparing knots for the constrained GAM
n.knots <- 5
knots <- list(AgeCap = seq(min(MRdata$AgeCap, na.rm = TRUE), max(MRdata$AgeCap, na.rm = TRUE), length = n.knots))
#Fit a constrained GAM - constrained so that at x=0 y=plogis(-min.val) 
# (where min.val is about -4) so about 0.  Note that the choice of min.val
# affects the fit, unfortunately.
min.val <- -4
sm <- smoothCon(s(AgeCap, k = n.knots, bs = "cr"), data = MRdata, knots = knots)[[1]]

X <- sm$X[, -1]
S <- sm$S[[1]][-1, -1]
off.set <- MRdata$Marked * 0 + min.val 

gamAge.constr <- gam(Marked ~ X - 1 + offset(off.set), paraPen = list(X = list(S)), 
                         data = MRdata, family = binomial)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
newdata = data.frame(AgeCap = AgeCap)
sm2 <- smoothCon(s(AgeCap, k = n.knots, bs = "cr"), data = newdata, knots = knots)[[1]]
X2 <- sm2$X[, -1]
S2 <- sm2$S[[1]][-1, -1]
off.set2 <- rep(min.val, length = nrow(newdata))
y.pred2 <- predict(gamAge.constr, newdata = list(AgeCap = newdata$AgeCap, X = X2, off.set = off.set2))
y.pred2 <- plogis(y.pred2)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#Plot the data
par(mfrow=c(1,1),mar=c(4,4,0.5,0.5))
with(MRdata, plot(Marked ~ AgeCap,xlim=c(0,45)))
lines(newdata$AgeCap, y.pred2, col = "green")
```

We generate resamples from this model to propagate model uncertainty further. Here we make 4,000 replicate predictions for integer ages from 0 to 40 and save these to a csv file.

We present also the observed proportions of marked animals as a function of age as a goodness of fit assessment. The fit looks reasonable, except for the first bin, where we predict a lower proportion of marked animals than that observed. 

This is likely induced by the fact that the process of marking as a function of (young) age is not well approximated by the logistic link function. We move forward assuming that the impacts of this misfit would be negligible for our purposes, especially given all the uncertainty around this process. 

```{r}
AgeCap <- 0:60
newdata = data.frame(AgeCap = AgeCap)
sm2 <- smoothCon(s(AgeCap, k = n.knots, bs = "cr"), data = newdata, knots = knots)[[1]]
X2 <- sm2$X[, -1]
S2 <- sm2$S[[1]][-1, -1]
off.set2 <- rep(min.val, length = nrow(newdata))

set.seed(20932)
#Plot the data
with(MRdata,plot(Marked~AgeCap,xlim=c(0,45)))
#Make predictions
Xp <- predict(gamAge.constr, newdata = list(AgeCap = newdata$AgeCap, X = X2, off.set = off.set2), type = "lpmatrix")
# define number of resamples
B <- 4000
br <- MASS::mvrnorm(B, coef(gamAge.constr), gamAge.constr$Vp)
res <- numeric(B)

predictions <- matrix(0, B, length(AgeCap))
for(i in 1:B){
  predictions[i, ] <- plogis(Xp %*% br[i, ] + min.val)[, 1]
  lines(AgeCap,predictions[i, ]) 
}
#Add in the original fit
ori.AgeCap <- seq(0, max(MRdata$AgeCap), length = 1000)
lines(ori.AgeCap, y.pred2, col = "green", lwd = 2)
#Divide data into n.dots equal portions by age and calculate proportion of marked for each portion
n.dots <- 7
ord <- order(MRdata$AgeCap)
ind <- rep(1:n.dots, each = length(ord)/n.dots)
if(length(ind) > length(ord)) ind <- ind[1:length(ord)]
ind <- c(ind, rep(n.dots, length(ord) - length(ind)))
mean.p <- by(MRdata$Marked[ord], ind, mean)
mean.age <- by(MRdata$AgeCap[ord], ind, mean)
mean.n <- by(MRdata$AgeCap[ord], ind, length)
points(mean.age, mean.p, pch = 16, col = "blue")
for(i in 1:length(mean.p)){
  conf <- Hmisc::binconf(mean.p[i] * mean.n[i], mean.n[i])
  lines(c(mean.age[i], mean.age[i]), conf[2:3], col = "blue")
}
```

In the above, the black lines are `r B` replicate predictions from the fit, the blue dots are the average proportion marked from the data grouped into `r n.dots` approximately equally sized bins and the blue vertical lines are 95\% binomial confidence intervals on these proportions. 

Below we represent the probability of being marked as a function of age and the corresponding pointwise percentile confidence intervals.

```{r}
#plot mean predictions, with confidence interval
plot(AgeCap, apply(predictions, 2, mean), type = "l", ylab = "p(marked)", xlab = "Age")
lines(AgeCap, apply(predictions, 2, quantile, 0.025),  lty = 2)
lines(AgeCap, apply(predictions, 2, quantile, 0.975),  lty = 2)
```

**TAM: The confidence bands above seem narrower than what I'd expect from the first plot???**

```{r}
# write results to use further, as neded 
write.csv(predictions,"InputFiles/pmarked.csv",row.names = FALSE)
```

## Age and sex specific survival

The Siler model provides us the probability of survival as a function of age and sex.

A separate description of the survival for the different taxonomic units is the purpose of "ComparingSurvivalsAcrossStocks.Rmd". 

Replicating that code, here we simply use the Siler model to obtain survival as a function of age and sex for the botlenose dolphin baseline population.

## Proportion of animals in each sex and age class

Given the Siler model, and the population model assumed, we can also can also estimate the baseline abundance per sex and age class.

The baseline proportion of animals in each sex and age class can be obtained by running the same code that sets the baseline population of BND in the runSims.R function.

```{r}

```

Looking at the resulting proportion in each age and sex, while recognizing that this proportion takes strictly a value at each (discrete) age while the representation below is a continous representation of that discrete function.

```{r}
#being lazy and using the ggplot code above!
#to do so re-structure results
SAFEdistNominais<-distNominais
distNominais<-as.data.frame(t(distNominais))
#To understand why this code works one needs to realize that #once like this the data structure is the same as in object
#pxMF above, so we can use what was done there
# add means and relevant quantiles
dNmean <- rowMeans(distNominais)
dNq025 <- apply(X=distNominais,MARGIN = 1,FUN=quantile,probs=0.025)
dNq975 <- apply(X=distNominais,MARGIN = 1,FUN=quantile,probs=0.975)
#now collect
distNominais$mean <- dNmean
distNominais$q025 <- dNq025
distNominais$q975 <- dNq975
#add the sex
pxFs2$sex="Female"
pxMs2$sex="Male"
#add age and sex
distNominais$sex<-pxMF$sex
distNominais$ages<-pxMF$ages
#plot
ggplot(data=distNominais, aes(x=ages, y=mean, ymin=q025, ymax=q975, fill=sex, linetype=sex)) + geom_line() + 
 geom_ribbon(alpha=0.5) + 
 xlab("Age") + 
 ylab("Proportion")
```

## Combining components to get $\bar S$

We finally combine the above components, as described [above](#estimating-the-population-average-survival) to obtain realizations of the population averaged baseline survival. 

This is then used in the simulations, combined with the results from the SCR analysis, to estimate the decrease in survival induced by exposure to oil. 

```{r}
meanS <-numeric(B)
for(i in 1:B){
  qijs<-c(distNominais[1:61,i]*predictions[i,],distNominais[62:122,i]*predictions[i,])/sum(c(distNominais[1:61,i]*predictions[i,],distNominais[62:122,i]*predictions[i,]))
meanS[i]<-sum(pxMF[,i]*qijs)
}
```

And now we can take a look at the distribution of the estimated population averaged survival

```{r,cache=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#stupid tweak
meanS=data.frame(S=meanS,group=" ")
#plot
#https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/89-box-and-scatter-plot-with-ggplot2.html
meanS %>% ggplot(aes(y=S,x=group)) +
     geom_boxplot() +
     scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha=0.6) +
     geom_jitter(color="black", size=0.4, alpha=0.9) +
     theme(
       legend.position="none",
       plot.title = element_text(size=11)
     ) +
     ggtitle("Baseline population average survival") +
     xlab("")
```

Finally, we output the resulting distribution of baseline survivals, which incorporates the variance propagated through each of the 3 required components, so that they can be used in the main simulations.

```{r}
write.table(meanS$S,file="InputFiles/BaselineSurvival.csv",quote=FALSE,row.names = FALSE,col.names = FALSE)
```

**Delete at the end:** Take a look at [this file](file:\\\C:\Users\tam2\Dropbox\Trabalho\Funded\CARMMHA\integrativemodelling\ModelComponents\0 Siler Model\EstimatingMeanAgeRangeSurv.html)

# Comparison with survival post oil-spil

Reading in the realizations of post-oil survival obtained from the SCR study. Full details about the methods and the results are described in Glennie et al. (2021).

```{r}
SpostOilBB<-read.csv(file="InOutBySp/Bottlenose_dolphin_BB/PostOilSurv.csv",header=FALSE,col.names = "S")
```

Comparing the pre oil spill with post oil spill survival. As expected the oil had a detrimental effect on survival, which is reassuring to observe in the figure below, since these two quantities were produced from completely independent sets of data.

```{r}
#preparing a suitable object for plotting with ggplot
PrePosS<-data.frame(S=c(SpostOilBB$S,meanS$S),period=c(rep("post-oil",length(SpostOilBB$S)),rep("baseline",length(meanS$S))))
```

```{r}
#plotting it
PrePosS %>% ggplot(aes(y=S,x=period,color=period)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="black") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha=0.6) +
  geom_jitter(size=0.4, alpha=0.1) +
  theme(
    legend.position="none",
    plot.title = element_text(size=11)
  ) +
  ggtitle("Comparison between baseline and post-oil population average survival") +
  xlab("")
```
