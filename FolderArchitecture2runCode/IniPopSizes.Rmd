# Preamble

***This will be a general preable common to all the documents included as Electronic Supplements to CARMMHA's offshore injury paper. The exact preamble will be finalized at the time of submission to reflect the submission date and final title, structure, authors etc.***

This is an Electronic Supplement to the paper submited to MEPS on the ??-??-???? by Marques, T. A., Thomas, L., Booth, C., Garrison, L. P., Rosel, P. E., Mullin, K. D. & L. Schwacke entitled "Quantifying Deepwater Horizon oil spill induced injury on offshore cetaceans".

# Introduction

In this document we present the distribution for the initial population sizes, population exposed and proportion exposed for each of the stocks considered in the paper.

These population sizes were obtained from the models of 

Roberts, J. J.; Best, B. D.; Mannocci, L.; Fujioka, E.; Halpin, P. N.; Palka, D. L.; Garrison, L. P.; Mullin, K. D.; Cole, T. V. N.; Khan, C. B.; McLellan, W. A.; Pabst, D. A. & Lockhart, G. G. (2016) Habitat-based cetacean density models for the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Scientific Reports 6: 22615 

To obtain the number of animals exposed to oil (and hence the proportion of the population exposed to oil) the estimated fraction of the population based on the density surfaces that was contained in the area considered to be affected by oil was quatified. Said area is shown in the image below

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 10}
include_graphics(path = "figs/Figure1.JPG")
```

# Reading in data and creating plots


```{r, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Define the species we run simulations for
# Species ordered by alphabetic order of the 4 letter code used to refer to them.
Sps <- c("Bwsp", "Fatt", "Gmac", "Ggri", "Kosp", "Pele", "Pmac", "Satt", "Sbre", "Scly", "Scoe", "Sfro", "Slon", "Ttro", "Ttrs", "Ttru")
source("Functions/reqfuns.R")         # most functions are here
```


```{r, cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE}
#Set up a table to hold summary statistics by species
sumNsPes <- data.frame(Sp = Sps, NL = NA, N = NA, NU = NA, Ncv = NA, NeL = NA, Ne = NA, NeU = NA, Necv=NA, PeL = NA, Pe = NA, PeU = NA, Pecv= NA)
#and one to hold the number of iterations that were just non-sensically high
nonsense <- data.frame(Sp = Sps, limit=NA, above.limit = NA)
```

The objects containing realizations of population size, both for the total abundance as well as the proportion of animals exposed to oil, are in **2/3** separate objects:

* N_boot.csv - the population size
* N_boot_in_oil.csv - the exposed population size
* N_bycell.csv - the estimated number of animals per grid cell (**not used in runSims.Rmd... why do we share this? might not make sense to do so? - on hold, now we need to get the code working!**)

These are in folder "InOutBySp", stored under a sub-folder corresponding to each taxonomic unit. The code to create these objects, as well as the actual density surface models from Roberts et al. 2016 over which they are based upon are not shared, since they are not ours to share. In that sense these should be taken as data.

The species considered and the corresponding codes are:

* Bwsp beaked whales	Beaked whales spp
* Fatt pygmy killer whale	*Feresa attenuata*
* Gmac short-finned pilot whale	*Globicephala macrorhynchus*
* Ggri Risso's dolphin	*Grampus griseus*
* Kosp kogia	*Kogia* sp.
* Pele melon-headed whale	*Peponocephala electra*
* Pmac sperm whale	*Physeter macrocephalus*
* Satt pantropical spotted dolphin *Stenella attenuata*
* Sbre rough-toothed dolphin	*Steno bredanensis*
* Scly Clymene dolphin	*Stenella clymene*
* Scoe striped dolphin	*Stenella coeruleoalba*
* Sfro Atlantic spotted dolphin	*Stenella frontalis*
* Slon spinner dolphin	*Stenella longirostris*
* Ttro offshore bottlenose dolphins	*Tursiops truncatus*
* Ttrs shelf bottlenose dolphins *Tursiops truncatus*

In the following we produce a plot for the initial population versus the exposed population and for the initial population versus the proportion exposed for each of the stocks considered.

```{r, cache = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
for (j in 1:length(Sps)){
Sp <- Sps[j]
SpInfo <- getSpData(Sp)
print(paste0("The following pairs of plots are for ", Sps[j]))
# Initial population size
  Nstart <- read.csv(paste0("InOutBySp/", SpInfo$folder, "/N_boot.csv"), header = TRUE)
  Nstart <- Nstart[, 2]
  Nstart<-as.vector(Nstart)
  # Population exposed
  Nexp <- read.csv(paste0("InOutBySp/", SpInfo$folder, "/N_boot_in_oil.csv"), header = TRUE)
  Nexp <- Nexp[, 2]
  Nexp<-as.vector(Nexp)
#Note: naturally the proportion exposed is Nexp/Nstart
  
#define a limit to exclude weird values caused by rogue GAM extrapolations
# consider 1 order of magnitude above the mean
# 5 is the value we ended with
# 200 leads to effectively no exclusion and can be used for comparison
mult.sd <- 5
lim.rogue <- mean(Nstart) + mult.sd * sd(Nstart)
#mult <- 5
#lim.rogue <- mult*mean(Nstart)
index.NOT.rogue <- Nstart < lim.rogue
index.rogue <- Nstart > lim.rogue
print(paste0("We removed ", sum(index.rogue), " observation(s) that were considered GAM extrapolations gone bad"))
#save nonsense limit and number of simulations exceeding it
nonsense$limit[j] <- lim.rogue
nonsense$above.limit[j]  <-  sum(index.rogue)
#selecting just non rogue values
Nstart <- Nstart[index.NOT.rogue]
Nexp <- Nexp[index.NOT.rogue]
# plot initial populations
plotIP(Nstart, Nexp, type=1)
plotIP(Nstart, Nexp, type=2)
sumNsPes$NL[j] <- quantile(Nstart, 0.025)
sumNsPes$N[j] <- mean(Nstart)
sumNsPes$NU[j] <- quantile(Nstart, 0.975)
sumNsPes$Ncv[j] <- 100*sd(Nstart)/mean(Nstart)
sumNsPes$NeL[j] <- quantile(Nexp, 0.025)
sumNsPes$Ne[j] <- mean(Nexp)
sumNsPes$NeU[j] <-  quantile(Nexp, 0.975)
sumNsPes$Necv[j] <- 100*sd(Nexp)/mean(Nexp)
sumNsPes$PeL[j] <-  quantile(Nexp/Nstart, 0.025)
sumNsPes$Pe[j] <- mean(Nexp/Nstart)
sumNsPes$PeU[j] <-  quantile(Nexp/Nstart, 0.975)
sumNsPes$Pecv[j] <- 100*sd(Nexp/Nstart)/mean(Nexp/Nstart)
}
```


A summary table, with the estimated mean for the initial population size, the exposed population size and the proportion exposed for each of the stocks considered. The sufix L and U stand for Lower and Upper confidence interval bounds, respectively. These were obntained by the quantile method. The empirical coefficient of variation of each quantity is also shown.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(sumNsPes, digits = c(0, rep(0, 3), 1, rep(0, 3), 1,rep(3, 3), 1))
```

A quick check to see how many iterations were above the limit considered to be unrealistic and caused by GAM extrapolations

```{r}
kable(nonsense, digits = c(0, 0, 0), caption = "Limit beyond which values for each species were removed given they were considered nonsensical values caused by GAM extrapolations, and corresponding number of iterations that were removed.")
```
