# Introduction

This document is a master file that presents a full list of [Electronic Supplements available](#list-of-key-documents-on-this-repository). 

All these files are created as dynamic reports using RMarkdown. 

The source .Rmd files are provided in the github repository:

https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/CARMMHApapersSI

The above repository also includes all the code required for readers to reproduce independently the paper results. [Below](#how-to-reproduce-the-paper-results) is a quick description of how all the results in the paper might be recreated by the reader, within a framework of [reproducible research](#reproducible-research).

# List of key documents on this repository

Other key files names and brief content descriptions follow:

* [BND_InitialPopulation](BND_InitialPopulation.html) – Initial population size distribution and baseline survival. These are taken as data inputs, and the detailed analysis that describes how these were obtained is part of a separate dedicated effort where a spatially explicit capture recapture model was implemented (Glennie et al.,2021).

* [SurvivalReduction](SurvivalReduction.html) – Supplementary material about how we obtain the survival reduction factor. This combines baseline survival probability with post-spill  survival probability obtained by spatial capture recapture (SCR). For the baseline survival probability we describe the analysis that integrates the different components required. The  post-spill survival for Barataria Bay bottlenose dolphins is obtained in a separate paper, Glennie et al (2021).

* [BND_FecundityReduction](BND_FecundityReduction.html) – Supplementary material about how we approximate the reproduction success with a Beta random variable and how we derive from it the fecundity reduction factor.

* [AgeOfSexualMaturity](AgeOfSexualMaturity.html) - Supplementary material with details about how we obtained the age at first reproduction for *Tursiops truncatus*.

* [BNDinjury_Figs](BNDinjury_Figs.html) - R code for obtaining figures 3, 4 and 5, as well as the injury metrics results presented on the paper.

* [BNDModelEvaluation](BNDModelEvaluation.html) - The R code for the production of all the sensitivity analysis.

# How to reproduce the paper results

All the results in the paper can be recreated by the reader by running the code provided. Having the code also facilitates extending and using the code under different scenarios, species and locations.

The results shown in the paper tables are produced by different code files from the supplementary material. To get the paper results you need to run two files:

* `run_BND_Ttru_PopSims.R` - to get the main results.


* `Run_BND_Ttru_PopSimsSensitivity.R` - to run the sensitivity analysis.

The folder structure and all files required to successfully run the code is in the above github repository (under folder `FolderArchitecture2runCode`). The recommended procedure is to download this entire folder into a local folder and then run the above files.

At a bare minimum running the code requires the following folders and the material provided in them:

* `InputFiles`: this folder includes a number of files that are treated as data, inputs required to run the code, including the key file `SpeciesDefinitionFile.xlsx` that contains parameters for all the different taxonomic units in CARMMHA project, including the Barataria Bay bottlenose dolphins.

* `InOutBySp\Bottlenose_dolphin_BB`:  a folder that also contains species specific input files, namely "N_boot.csv" and "N_boot_in_oil.csv", a distribution of initial population sizes of both all animals and exposed animals. This is also the folder where results are outputed to by default.

* `Functions`: folder containing all the R code including functions required to run the simulations

Note that the code could take a considerable amount of time to run. The consequence of running the code will be to populate the folder `InOutBySp\Bottlenose_dolphin_BB` with the R workspaces holding the results that the rest of the code in [BNDinjury_Figs.Rmd](BNDinjury_Figs.pdf) and [BNDModelEvaluation.Rmd](BNDModelEvaluation.pdf) uses to produce the tables with injury metrics.

# Reproducible research

We have invested a considerable amount of time to make our analysis reproducible. This means also that it should be relatively straightforward for a reader to update the results with new information, be it new data that becomes available or different assumptions about population, allowing to explore both the consequences of new knowledge or the impact of the assumptions we made on the results presented.
