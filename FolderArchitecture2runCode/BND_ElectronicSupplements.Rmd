# Preamble

This is an Electronic Supplement to the manuscript Schwacke, L.A. et al.  "Modeling population impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on a long-lived species: implications and recommendations for future environmental disasters"

The master file containing links to all supplementary files related to this paper is [BND_Electronic Supplements master file](BND_ElectronicSupplements.html).

If you make use of any of this material in your work, it would be appreciated if you would [contact Tiago

# Introduction

This file is named "BND_ElectronicSupplements.pdf". This document is a master file that presents a full list of [Electronic Supplements available](#list-of-key-documents-on-this-repository). 

All these files are created as dynamic reports using RMarkdown. Given these being RMarkdown you might be reading this as a pdf, as a html or as a word, depending on how the corresponding .Rmd was compiled. The original .Rmd files are provided in the original github repository:

https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/CARMMHApapersSI

The above repository also includes all the code required for readers to reproduce independently the paper results. [Below](#how-to-reproduce-the-paper-results) is a quick description of how all the results in the paper might be recreated by the reader, within a framework of [reproducible research](#reproducible-research).

# List of key documents on this repository

[Back to Introduction](#introduction)

Other key files names and brief content descriptions follow:

* [BND_InitialPopulation](BND_InitialPopulation.html) – Initial population size distribution and baseline survival. These are taken as data inputs, and the detailed analysis that describes how these were obtained is part of a separate dedicated effort where a spatially explicit capture recapture model was implemented (Glennie et al.,2021).

* [SurvivalReduction](SurvivalReduction.html) – Supplementary material about how we obtain the survival reduction factor. This combines baseline survival probability with post oil survival probability obtained by SCR. For the baseline survival probability we describe the analysis that integrates the different components required. The survival post oil spill for Barataria Bay bottlenose dolphins is obtained in a separate paper, Glennie et al (2021).

* [AgeOfSexualMaturity](AgeOfSexualMaturity.html) - Supplementary material with details about how we obtained the age at first reproduction for *Tursiops truncatus*;

* [BNDinjury_Figs](BNDinjury_Figs.html) - obtaining figures 3, 4 and 5, as well as the injury metrics results presented on the paper;

* [BNDModelEvaluation](BNDModelEvaluation.html) - the code for the production of all the sensitivity analysis ;

# How to reproduce the paper results

[Back to Introduction](#introduction)

All the results in the paper can be recreated by the reader by running the code provided. Having the code also facilitates extending and using the code under different scenarios, species and locations. This is considered the most convenient way to share the results, since all the outputs would be too large to share in the github repository.

## All the results

The results shown in the paper tables are produced by different bits of code from the supplementary material. To get the paper results you need to run two files:

* `run_BND_Ttru_PopSims.R` - to get the main results. This is the code output next for readability

```{r , eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#this runs all the simulations and produces outputs for Ttru BND species
source("Functions/runPopSims.R")        
#define the number of iterations to run
ns <- 9999
# define the number of years each iteration is run for
ny <- 75
runPopSims(Sp = "Ttru", nsims = ns, nyears = ny, seed = 7134672)
```


* `Run_BND_Ttru_PopSimsSensitivity.R` - to run the sensitivity analysis. This is the code output here for readability

```{r , eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#this runs all the simulations and produces outputs for BND Ttru
source("Functions/reqfuns.R")         # auxiliary functions are here
source("Functions/SilerFuns.R")       # Siler model functions are here
source("Functions/runPopSims.R")      # the main simulation function

# ------------
# define the parameters that we evaluate sensitivity for
# "a1r" - age at first reproduction - uses mean of Gamma if par not "a1r" in runSimsSensitivity
# "N0" - initial population size - uses mean of realizations if par not "N0" in runSimsSensitivity
# "per" - proportion exposed that recovers - uses mean of realizations if par not "per" in runSimsSensitivity
# "Fmax" - Maximum fecundity - uses mean of realizations if par not "Fmax" in runSimsSensitivity
# "Fnom" - Nominal Fecundity - uses mean of realizations if par not "Fnom" in runSimsSensitivity
# "rho" - density dependence parameter - uses mean of realizations if par not "rho" in runSimsSensitivity
# "br" - baseline reproduction - uses mean of realizations if par not "br" in runSimsSensitivity
# "por" - post spill reproductive success rate - uses mean of realizations if par not "por" in runSimsSensitivity
# "spos" - post oil spill survival  - uses mean of realizations if par not "spos" in runSimsSensitivity (SR for non Ttru)
# "ascS" -  age sex class survival -  uses mean of realizations of survival curves if par not "ascS" in runSimsSensitivity
# "PM" - proportion marked  -  uses mean of realizations of P(marked|age) if par not "PM" in runSimsSensitivity
# ---------------
# While pe is always 1 for Ttru, it is nonetheless evaluated, as a control: no variability is expected
# "pe" - proportion exposed - uses mean of realizations if par not "N0" in runSimsSensitivity
# ---------------

#list of parameters
parS <- c("a1r","N0","pe","per","Fmax","Fnom","rho","br","por","spos","ascS","PM")

#define the number of iterations to run
ns <- 500
# define the number of years each iteration is run for
ny <- 75
# For each parameter we want to evaluate sensitivity for, see list above  

for (j in parS) {
  runPopSims(Sp = "Ttru", type = "Sens", nsims = ns, nyears = ny, par =j)
}
```


The folder structure and all files required to successfully run the code is in the above github repository (under folder `FolderArchitecture2runCode`). The recommended procedure is to download this entire folder into a local folder and then run the above files.

At a bare minimum running the code requires the following folders and the material provided in them:

* `InputFiles`: this folder includes a number of files that are treated as data, inputs required to run the code, including the key file `SpeciesDefinitionFile.xlsx` that contains parameters for all the different taxonomic units in CARMMHA project, including the Barataria Bay bottlenose dolphins.

* `InOutBySp\Bottlenose_dolphin_BB`:  a folder that also contains species specific input files, namely "N_boot.csv" and "N_boot_in_oil.csv", a distribution of initial population sizes of both all animals and exposed animals. This is also the folder where results are outputed to by default.

* `Functions`: folder containing all the R code including functions required to run the simulations

Note that the code could take a considerable amount of time to run. The consequence of running said chunk will be to populate the folder `InOutBySp\Bottlenose_dolphin_BB` with the R workspaces holding the results that the rest of the code in [BNDinjury_Fig4.Rmd](BNDinjury_Fig4.pdf) and [BNDModelEvaluation.Rmd](BNDModelEvaluation.pdf) uses to produce the tables with injury metrics.

# Reproducible research

We have invested a considerable amount of time to make our analysis reproducible. This means also that it should be relatively straightforward for a reader to update the results with new information, be it new data that becomes available or different assumptions about population, allowing to explore both the consequences of new knowledge or the impact of the assumptions we made on the results presented.
