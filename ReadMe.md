This is a github repository that holds all the code required to reproduce the results in the Integrative Modeling papers that assess the injury on the cetacean populations of the Gulf of Mexico DeepWater Horizon explosion in 2010.

These papers were created within the project CARMMHA. For more about CARMMHA project please visit

https://www.carmmha.org

There are two main papers:

1. A paper focused on bottlenose dolphins in Barataria Bay, where all the animals are assumed to have been exposed to oil
2. A paper focusing on 15 pelagic taxonomic units, including both dolphins :dolphin: and whales :whale:, where the different taxa were exposed to different extents to oil

Here we describe how you can navigate through this material. We note upfront that while there are two different papers, the underlying population dynamics simulation code that allows us to simulate populations of animals in the presence of oil and in the absence of oil is common to both papers. 

Hence, the results for both papers can  be obtained by running the same code just by using different arguments to the key functions involved in running the population dynamics model and that evaluate the injury metrics.

There are two master files that facilitate access to the material provided:

A short paper submitted to Marine Mammal Science, describing the effects on Bottlenose dolphin Barataria Bay population dynamics of a proposed Mississippi river diversion project (Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion) also uses a slight adaptation of the code required for the main papers. The master file to navigate those files is here:
