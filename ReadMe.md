This is a github repository that holds all the code required to reproduce the results in the Integrative Modeling papers that assess the injury on the cetacean populations of the Gulf of Mexico DeepWater Horizon explosion in 2010.

These papers were created within the project CARMMHA. For more about CARMMHA project please visit

There are two papers:

1. A paper focused on bottlenose dolphin Barataria Bay, where all the animals are assumed to have been exposed to oil
2. A paper focusing on 15 pelagic taxonomic units, where the different taxa were exposed to different extents to oil

Here we describe how you can navigate through this material. We note upfront that while there are two different papers, the underlying population dynamics simulation code that allows us to simulate populations of animals in the presence of oil and in the absence of oil is common to  both papers. Hence, the results for both papers can actually be obtained by running the same code just by using different arguments to the key functions involved in running the poplation dynamics model and that evaluate the injury metrics.

The master file that allows you to understand the files required to recreate the results for the bottlenose dolphin paper focused on Barataria Bay is:

Needs to be created yet :), in close coordination with Lori

The master file that allows you to understand the files required to recreate the results for the pelagic paper is:

This is currently "Work In Progress". If you are reading it and are not in the CARMMHA team, bear with us as this is not live yet!
