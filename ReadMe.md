This is a github repository that holds all the code required to reproduce the results in the Integrative Modeling papers that assess the injury on the cetacean populations of the Gulf of Mexico DeepWater Horizon explosion in 2010.

These papers were created within the project CARMMHA. For more about CARMMHA project please visit

There are two papers:

1. A bottlenose dolphin paper focused on Barataria Bay
2. A pelagic paper focusing on 15 taxonomic units

Here we describe how you can navigate through this material. We note upfront that while there are two different papers, the underlying population dynamics code that underlies both papers is common, and hence the results for both papers can actually be obtained by running the same code. If you are only interested in the results for a single papers that can easily be accomplished too, as descibed below.
